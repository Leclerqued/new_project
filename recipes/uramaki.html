    <h4>Uramaki</h4>
        <p>Uramaki (裏巻, "inside-out roll") is a medium-sized cylindrical style of sushi with two or more fillings and was developed as a result of the creation of the California roll, as a method originally meant to hide the nori. 
        <p>Uramaki differs from other makimono because the rice is on the outside and the nori inside.</p>
        <p>The filling is surrounded by nori, then a layer of rice, and optionally an outer coating of some other ingredients such as roe or toasted sesame seeds. </p>
        <p>It can be made with different fillings, such as tuna, crab meat, avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber, or carrots.</p>
